"""
Attack Surface Mapper.

Deterministic (no LLM) mapper that reads a TechnicalProfile and produces a list
of AttackVector objects — each with literal probe strings targeting a specific
technical component found in the document.

Design principle: every probe uses ACTUAL VALUES from TechnicalProfile (e.g. real
field names, real token suffixes, real model names) so they hit the exact
vulnerability — not a generic test that any system would block.

Each AttackVector maps to one or more adversarial taxonomy IDs (A01-A20) and
produces 2-3 literal probes ready to send as GeneratedPrompts.
